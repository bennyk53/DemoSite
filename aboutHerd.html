        <h1> What is the Herd?</h1>
        <br>
        <p style="color: white;">
            The Herd is the self given name of the offensive linemen for the Waterloo Warriors. The term originated during the 2015 season
            and since has become the term used by all players, coaches, and fans to refer to the offensive linemen as a group. The word "Herd"
            stems from the word used to refer to a group of caddle. Offensive linemen are generally larger people standing at 6 feet and over as 
            well as weighing in at upwards of 300lbs. The large size of these individuals and the amount that they eat is similar to that of a
            cow or bull and thus the name of "Herd". The Herd are also a group of individuals who are tough hard nose people looking to beat up on
            opponents as well as protect their smaller brothers at all cost. This group tends to be the most close of all the groups on a team and
            rely on each other to perform at their best. They are usually found moving, eating and lying down in backs. 
        </p>
        <br>

        <h1> Why should I care about the Herd?</h1>
        <br>
        <p style="color: white;">
            If you are not part of the Herd it is common knowledge to shower the Herd with gifts of food and beer inorder to gain their favour.
            Having the Herd like you gains you privilige to attend Herd only gatherings such as BBQs, parties and other such social gatherings. 
            The Herd also has a proctection value. If they like you and you are a smaller individual they will protect you with their lives. 
            Gonna get beat up? The Herd will be there to protect you. Moving out? The Herd will be there to help you move. Hungry? The Herd is 
            always on the move looking for food and fresh flavour. Want to crush some beers and relax? The Herd enjoys beers almost as much as they
            enjoy not moving.  
        </p>
        <br>

        <h1> How can I join the Herd?</h1>
        <br>
        <p style="color: white;">
            The Herd is not a group that you can fill out an application form and wait for the commity to review your file and accept you.
            Your application is the kind of Lad you are around the boys. You must be an individual of great size or desire to gain such size. 
            Your performance on the field will also improve your chance of acceptance if you are "a dog" this helps. "A dog" refers to an individual
            who is working hard to improve, beating on the opponent, standing up for his fellow Herd members and helping his fellow Herd members. 
            There is no room for cowards, selfish individuals, or people who require praise. The Herd works in the dark where the only person who 
            cares what you do is your fellow Herd brothers and those few who choose to attempt to gain the favour of the Herd.
        </p>

        <h1>I don't believe "The Herd" is as great as advertised</h1>
        <br>
        <p style="color: white;">
            I will just let the below images speak for themselves. The below pictures are from a mere 1 single event of the Herd, that were 
            then used to create a calendar that raised money to help those with mental health issues.
