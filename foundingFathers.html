        <h1>Who are the Founding Fathers of the Herd?</h1>
        <br>
        <p style="color: white;">
            The Founding fathers of the Herd are the main offensive lineman playing for the 2015 Waterloo Warriors; Brock Thomson, 
            Kyle Boismier, Jesse Gibbon, and Ben Koczwara. At the time the offensive line was very depleated due to injuries of the other 
            players. Due to that the group had to be tight to pull together inorder to have any success. Brock was the first to use the term
            that would eventually become accepted across all members of the team when the lineman were on the move (rather slowly) and he yelled
            "Herd crossing". The response from both the other linemen as well as teammates was instant and everyone loved it. Other members began to use
            it and the offensive linemen area of the locker room was refered to as the pasture already so the word fit. Over and over the words was 
            used so that linemen began to take pride in being a "Herd" member. There was shirts and jerseys and hats made with the "Herd" on it 
            as well as common phrases like "Run the Damn Ball" or "It's a great day for Hay". Brock graduated at the end of the 2015 season and thus passed 
            the torch to the 3 young bucks Kyle, Jesse, and Ben. These 3 carried the torch of the Herd until the end of the 2018 season. In 2018 Ben graduated
            from Waterloo and Jesse was drafted by the Hamilton Tiger-Cats leaving Kyle to contiune as the last founding father still active for the 
            Warriors. After the 2019 season Kyle also graduated being the last founding father to graduate and unfortuantly have to leave the active Herd.
            The young members of the Herd are ready to take on the torch and continue the legacy of the Herd into the future.

        <h1>Who will continue now that the founding fathers are gone?</h1>
        <br>
        <p style="color: white;">
            All members of the Herd are taught about the importance of the Herd as an organization and the requirements of those who are to 
            become members of the Herd. Although there are no more founding fathers the young members are ready and know the importance of 
            being a Herd member and keeping that alive. Greg Brand is currently the next in line to carry the mantle of the leader of the Herd and 
            has been groomed to take over the position as he worked very closesly with the founding fathers and was very involved in the continued 
            growth of the Herd. He will help usher in a new era of Herd.
