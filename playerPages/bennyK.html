                    Ben Koczwara started his 5 years with the Waterloo Warriors in 2014, coming in as a H-back. After just 
                    1 practice he was sent down to play offensive line due to the lack of lineman they had, and the rest is history.
                    Ben proceeded to start and play all 40 regular season games of his career as well as 1 playoff game in the 2018 season.
                    During his time as a Warrior he moved around the offensive line playing left tackle 2 years before moving to centre and 
                    playing right tackle due to injuries. After his 3rd year he attended the USports East West game where he played guard and thus
                    caused him to play left gurad for his remaining 2 years for the Warriors. In 2018 he was selected by the Winnipeg Bluebombers,
                    but what was released to return to the Warriors and complete his time at university. In that final year Ben recieved a 1st Team OUA All Star spot.
                    After that Ben went to Bluebombers Camp where he was cut and was not added to any CFL roster for the year. In November
                    of 2019 he was selected 1st overall in the 1st ever LFA-CFL draft by the Saltillo Dinos where he played until the emergence of COVID-19. 
                    Ben now waits for the next opportunity once COVID is under control to continue his football career. Whether it be in Canada, the States, Mexico or across seas.

    <h2 style="color: white;"> This is a place holder here. With this kind of topic I have chosen for this website I cannot think of much to put,
        here. That being said for the players of the teams we can put a table containing stats from various events that
        they have patricipated in. See the below table of an example of a League of Legends player stats. This is a very crude
        table but just to give an idea
